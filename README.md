## Introduction :monocle_face:

 __Aim of the project:__ Create an SPA (Single Page Application) of a rental apartment web application named Kasa.
Provided to us a [figma's model](https://www.figma.com/file/bAnXDNqRKCRRP8mY2gcb5p/UI-Design-Kasa-FR?node-id=3%3A0) and contraints to follow.

As we can see in the Figma model we have 4 pages: :thinking:
* Home
* Appartement
* About
* Error: could be in the layout as a component with Banner component.

 |**Lists of Constraints**|
 | :--------|
 |Each component must have a dedicated file.
  Must use State and props when needed.
  Handling Events. 
  Transform arrays into lists of elements. _ex: __map__ method_ 
  When the user click on a specific partement it will redirect the userUrl to the apartment details.
  Each pages have their own Route.
  Implement a redirect to a custom 404 page using react router dom.
  No error in the console should appear.|

  > [!TIP]
> add a key to each child as well as each element inside children when using the map() function.
